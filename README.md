# 🧭 Wyrdroot - Text-Based Adventure Game

A simple text-based adventure game built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project is designed as a learning tool to help understand Python classes, object interaction, and basic game loops.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Navigate through different rooms
- Interact with items and objects
- Fight enemies (coming soon)
- Talk to NPCs (planned)
- Inventory system (coming soon)

---

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Object-Oriented Programming
- (Optional) Pygame or Tkinter for GUI (future)
